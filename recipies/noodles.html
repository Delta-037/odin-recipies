    <p>“Umami noodles that you can set and forget? It’s perfect!” said recipe tester Amanda Stanfield.</p>
    <p>This slow cooker recipe simmers flavorful chicken thighs to sweet and savory perfection. Toss in soft, springy noodles, and you get a
         bowl full of rich, belly-warming comfort the whole family will enjoy. Hey, just because the flavors are complex doesn’t mean the cooking process has to be.</p>
