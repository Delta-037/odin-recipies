This is my first project in my journey through the Odin Project. 

This basic HTML page seems simple (and it is) but I learned quite a bit about html by writing this.
I also got much more comfortable writing HTML and feel confident about writing basic HTML by memory.
Before completing this project I needed to refer back to things to remember the exact format of HTML, now I am comfortable with basic HTML. So far I'm loving the Odin Project and hope to learn much more.
